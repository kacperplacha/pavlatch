# Pavlatch - create your own storage service

I wanted to replace AWS S3 with some cheaper solution for small project.

Only two features:
- receiving file and store it locally
- checking if file already exist

## Requirements

Space on web hosting with php :smile:

## Client
Use https://github.com/kacperplacha/pavlatch-client
